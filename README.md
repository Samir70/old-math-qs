Learn maths by answering progressively harder questions

This project started as my maths-elo project, which would display random questions to test students. It had two types of interface, all in one app. Then I wanted a third interface and decided what I should have done is create the question generator as a seperate API to be used by as many front-ends as I like.

If you want to run your own fork locally, you will have to install firebase then use your own firebase account. Serve the page locally with 

> firebase serve
and push to your own firebase account with

> firebase deploy

Currently, the app can be accessed online at: https://maths-qs.web.app/ and https://maths-qs.firebaseapp.com/
